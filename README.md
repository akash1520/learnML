# Learn Machine Learning with me.

```
I'm also a beginner so, If you want to join me on this journey tag along. I'll document what I do and learn and you can use it as a resource.
```
## Starting off with a course.

> For the start I'm gonna follow a JS machine learning course from [freecodecamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDDjtwQDw2k&t=1955s) on youtube.


### Course Description
```
We will build a web app. In which you can draw anything and the app will try to identify which object did you draw using machine learning.
```

### Why did I choose this course?
- Because it's beginner friendly
- It's in javascript ( a language I'm familiar with)
- It isn't a black box course, where you just use bunch of different libraries and make the app but don't know what's really going on.

### Things we'll do in the course
> Phase 1:
- [] Building a web app
- [] Data Collection
- [] Data Manipulation
- [] Feature Extraction
- [] Data processing and visualization
- [] Nearest neighbour method
- [] Data Scaling
- [] K-Nearest neighbour method
- [] How to calculate decision boundaries

> Phase 2:

- [] Higher dimension
- [] Neural Networks
- [] Data cleaning
- [] Clustering
- [] Graphs

> Extras:
- [] Can say it's a good introduction to OOP if you haven't used it before.
- [] Intro to DOM manipulation

### DAY 1

- [] Html file, with div with id content
- [] add stylesheet and script
- [] create a class and constructor for SketchPad
- [] Use script to spawn Sketchpad on the htmlpage

- [] Add context and addeventlisteners method to the class of the sketchpad.
> '# represents that addeventlisteners is a private method
- [] Define addeventlisteners, use on mousedown event 
> Use getBoundingClientRect, clientX, clientY attributes to get mouse cordinates
- [] Add attributes path and isDrawing to class Sketchpad
- [] Add on mousemove event
- [] Add on mouseup event

- [] Create and use a new private method called get mouse to simply get mouse cordinates easily, so we don't need to define the same functionality again and again.
- [] Create a new private method redraw which will clear the canvas and draw the path.
- [] Create a new utility called draw.js in Web/js folder, attach the script in HTML, do read the comment there.

- (Learn more about Spread Operator)[https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab]

- [] create a public method called 'path' to create path using stroke, you might run into few errors so don't give up easily
